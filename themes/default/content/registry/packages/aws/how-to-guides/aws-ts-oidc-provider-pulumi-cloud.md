A Pulumi template to:

- Create AWS resources for AWS OIDC (IdP + Role)
- Create a new Pulumi Cloud ESC Environment (optional)

Last update: June 2024

## 📋 Pre-requisites

- AWS CLI and an AWS Account configured
- [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [Pulumi Cloud account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## 👩‍🏫 Get started

This Pulumi example is written as a template. It is meant to be copied via `pulumi new`

```bash
# login to your Pulumi Cloud if you haven't already
pulumi login

# pick a name for your output directory (--dir is optional, omit for pwd)
D=my-aws-oidc
pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-ts-oidc-provider-pulumi-cloud --dir ${D}
cd ${D}
```

Once copied to your machine, feel free to edit as needed.

## 🎬 How to run

Note that this templates contains a default value which contains a valid AWS OIDC thumbprint as of June 2024. If this thumbprint becomes invalid, obtain a new OIDC thumbprint. For more information, see [Obtain the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc_verify-thumbprint.html) in the AWS docs.

```bash
$ pulumi up
# select 'yes' to confirm the expected changes
# 🎉 Ta-Da!
```

## 🧹 Clean up

To clean up your infrastructure, run:

```bash
$ pulumi destroy
# select 'yes' to confirm the expected changes
