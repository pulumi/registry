To provision an Azure Quickstart ACR Geo Replicated Registry with this component, you need to have Azure credentials. Use the instructions on the Azure Native Provider's [Installation & Configuration]({{< relref "/registry/packages/azure-native/installation-configuration" >}}) to get credentials if needed.

**Your Azure credentials are never sent to Pulumi.com.** Pulumi uses the Azure SDK and the credentials in your environment to authenticate requests from your computer to Azure.
