To provision resources with the Pulumi Azure provider, you need to have Azure credentials.
Your Azure credentials are never sent to Pulumi.com.
Pulumi uses the Azure SDK and the credentials in your environment to authenticate requests from your computer to Azure.

## Installation

The Azure Classic provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/azure`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/azure)
* Python: [`pulumi-azure`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-azure/)
* Go: [`github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure/sdk/v4/go/azure`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure)
* .NET: [`Pulumi.Azure`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.Azure)
* Java: [`com.pulumi.azure`](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.pulumi.azure)


## Authentication Methods

Pulumi can authenticate to Azure via several methods:
- Azure CLI
- Service Principal with a client secret or certificate
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Managed Service Identity (MSI)

If you're running the Pulumi CLI locally, in a developer scenario, we recommend using the Azure CLI.  For team
environments, particularly in CI, one of the other options is strongly recommended.

{{% notes type="info" %}}
Authenticating using the CLI will not work for Service Principal logins (e.g.,
`az login --service-principal`).  For such cases, authenticate using the Service Principal method instead.

### Authenticate using the CLI

The CLI instructions assume you're using the [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) (`az`).

Log in to the Azure CLI and Pulumi will automatically use your credentials:

```bash
$ az login
A web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`.
```

Do as instructed to log in.  After completed, `az login` will return and you are ready to go.

If you're using Government or China Clouds, you'll need to configure the Azure CLI to work with that cloud.  Do so by running `az cloud set --name <Cloud>`, where `<Cloud>` is one of `AzureUSGovernment` or `AzureChinaCloud`.
{{% /notes %}}

The Azure CLI, and thus Pulumi, will use the Default Subscription by default. You can override the subscription by setting your subscription ID to the `id` output from `az account list`'s output:

```bash
$ az account list
```

Pick out the `<id>` from the list and run:

```bash
$ az account set --subscription=<id>
```

### Authenticate with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OIDC allows you to establish a trust relationship between Azure and another identity provider such as GitHub. Once
established, your program can exchange a token issued by the identity provider (in this case, GitHub) for an Azure
token. Your Pulumi program running in, for instance, GitHub Actions CI, can then access Azure, without storing any
secrets in GitHub.

#### OIDC Azure Configuration

To configure the trust relationship in Azure, please refer to
[this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions).
This needs to be set up only once.

Additionally, you may find the
[GitHub OIDC documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
helpful.

#### OIDC Pulumi Provider Configuration

To use OIDC, either set the Pulumi configuration `useOidc` via `pulumi config set azure:useOidc true` or set the
environment variable `ARM_USE_OIDC` to "true".

Next, supply the provider with an ID token and a URL to use for exchange. In GitHub, we don't need to configure
this since GitHub sets the relevant environment variables `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` and
`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` by default and the provider reads them. In other scenarios, set the Pulumi configuration
`azure:oidcRequestToken` or environment variable `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN` for the token, and configuration
`azure:oidcRequestUrl` or environment variable `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_URL` for the URL.

Finally, configure the client and tenant IDs of your Azure Active Directory application. Refer to the
[above Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp)
on how to retrieve the IDs, and set them via Pulumi config as `azure:clientId` and `azure:tenantId` or via environment
variables as `ARM_CLIENT_ID` and `ARM_TENANT_ID`.

{{% notes type="info" %}}
If you get the error "_AADSTS70021: No matching federated identity record found for presented assertion_", this points
to a configuration issue with the _entity type_ and _environment name_ described in the Azure documentation. Make sure
they match your setup, e.g., the type "branch" and the correct branch name if CI runs against a fixed branch.

### Authenticate using a Service Principal

A Service Principal is an application in Azure Active Directory with a client ID and a tenant ID, exactly like the one
used in the OIDC scenario. In this scenario, instead of a pre-configured trust relationship, a client secret is used to
authenticate with Azure. 

#### Create your Service Principal and get your tokens

To use a Service Principal, you must first create one. If you already have one, skip this section.

You can create a Service Principal [using the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), [using the Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/), or [using the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal?view=azure-cli-latest).

After creating a Service Principal, you will obtain three important tokens:

* `appId` is the client ID
* `password` is the client secret
* `tenant` is the tenant ID

For example, a common Service Principal as displayed by the Azure CLI looks something like this:

```json
{
  "appId": "WWWWWWWW-WWWW-WWWW-WWWW-WWWWWWWWWWWW",
  "displayName": "ServicePrincipalName",
  "name": "http://ServicePrincipalName",
  "password": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "tenant": "YYYYYYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYY"
}
```

You also need to obtain a Subscription ID. To retrieve your current Subscription ID, you can use:

```bash
$ az account show --query id -o tsv
```

To list all available subscriptions, you can use:

```bash
$ az account list --query '[].{subscriptionName:name,subscriptionId:id}' -o tsv
```

#### Make tokens available to Pulumi

Once you have the Service Principal's authorization tokens, choose one of the ways below to make them available to Pulumi:

##### Set configuration using `pulumi config`

Remember to pass `--secret` when setting `clientSecret` so that it is properly encrypted:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set azure:clientId <clientID>
    $ pulumi config set azure:clientSecret <clientSecret> --secret
    $ pulumi config set azure:tenantId <tenantID>
    $ pulumi config set azure:subscriptionId <subscriptionId>
    ```

##### Set configuration using environment variables

{{< chooser os "linux,macos,windows" >}}
{{% choosable os linux %}}

```bash
$ export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_ARM_CLIENT_ID>
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_ARM_CLIENT_SECRET>
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID=<YOUR_ARM_TENANT_ID>
$ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<YOUR_ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable os macos %}}

```bash
$ export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_ARM_CLIENT_ID>
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_ARM_CLIENT_SECRET>
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID=<YOUR_ARM_TENANT_ID>
$ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<YOUR_ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
```

> $env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<YOUR_ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
```

## Configuration options

Use `pulumi config set azure:<option>` or pass options to the [constructor of `new azure.Provider`](/registry/packages/azure/api-docs/provider).

| Option | Required? | Description |

| `environment`  Required  The cloud environment to use. It can also be sourced from the ARM_ENVIRONMENT environment variable. Supported values are: `public` (default), `usgovernment`, `china`. |
| `location`  Optional | The location to use. ResourceGroups will consult this property for a default location, if one was not supplied explicitly. |
| `clientId` | Optional | The client ID to use. It can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. |
| `clientSecret` | Optional | The client secret to use. It can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable. |
