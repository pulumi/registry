The Azure DevOps provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/azuredevops`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/azuredevops)
* Python: [`pulumi-azuredevops`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-azuredevops/)
* Go: [`github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azuredevops/sdk/v3/go/azuredevops`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azuredevops)
* .NET: [`Pulumi.Azuredevops`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.Azuredevops)
* Java: [`com.pulumi/azuredevops`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.pulumi/azuredevops)

## Overview

The Azure DevOps provider can be used to configure Azure DevOps project in [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) using [Azure DevOps Service REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-7.0)
