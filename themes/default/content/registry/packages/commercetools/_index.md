## Generate Provider

```bash
pulumi package add terraform-provider labd/commercetools
```

## Installation
Pulumi automatically downloads providers from the pulumi registry. Add the
following to your pulumi project

Packages of the releases are available at the GitHub Repo.
See the pulumi documentation
for more information about installing third-party providers.
## Using the provider
The provider attempts to read the required values from environment variables:
- `CTP_CLIENT_ID`
- `CTP_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CTP_PROJECT_KEY`
- `CTP_SCOPES`
- `CTP_API_URL`
- `CTP_AUTH_URL`

Alternatively, you can set it up directly in the pulumi file:

```yaml
# Pulumi.yaml provider configuration file
name: configuration-example
runtime:
config:
    commercetools:apiUrl:
        value: <api url>
    commercetools:clientId:
        value: <your client id>
    commercetools:clientSecret:
        value: <your client secret>
    commercetools:projectKey:
        value: <your project key>
    commercetools:scopes:
        value: <space seperated list of scopes>
    commercetools:tokenUrl:
        value: <token url>

```

## Using with docker

The included `Dockerfile` bundles the official  `pulumi/pulumi:light` docker image with
our `pulumi-provider-commercetools`.

To build the docker image file locally, use:
```sh
docker build . -t pulumi-with-provider-commercetools:latest
```
Then you can run a pulumi command on files in the current directory with:
```sh
docker run -v "${pwd}:/config" pulumi-with-provider-commercetools:latest <CMD>
```
