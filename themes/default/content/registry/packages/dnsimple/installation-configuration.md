The Pulumi DNSimple provider uses the DNSimple SDK to manage and provision resources.

## Installation

The DNSimple provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/dnsimple`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/dnsimple)
* Python: [`pulumi-dnsimple`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-dnsimple/)
* Go: [`github.com/pulumi/pulumi-dnsimple/sdk/v3/go/dnsimple`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-dnsimple)
* .NET: [`Pulumi.Dnsimple`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.Dnsimple)

## Configuring Credentials

Pulumi relies on the DNSimple SDK to authenticate requests from your computer to DNSimple. Your credentials are never sent
to pulumi.com. The Pulumi DNSimple Provider needs to be configured with DNSimple credentials
before it can be used to create resources.

Once the credentials are obtained, there are two ways to communicate your authorization tokens to Pulumi:

1. Set the environment variable `DNSIMPLE_TOKEN` and `DNSIMPLE_ACCOUNT`:

    ```bash
    $ export DNSIMPLE_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    $ export DNSIMPLE_ACCOUNT=YYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    ```

2. Set them using configuration, if you prefer that they be stored alongside your Pulumi stack for easy multi-user access:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set dnsimple:token XXXXXXXXXXXXXX --secret
    $ pulumi config set dnsimple:account YYYYYYYYYYYYYY --secret
    ```

Remember to pass `--secret` when setting `dnsimple:token` and `dnsimple:account` so that they are properly encrypted. The complete list of
configuration parameters is in the [DNSimple provider README](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-dnsimple/blob/master/README.md).
