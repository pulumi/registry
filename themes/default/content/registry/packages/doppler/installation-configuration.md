## Authentication

The Pulumi Doppler Provider needs to be configured with a Doppler `API Key` and `Account ID` before it can be used to create resources.

> If you don't have an `API Key`, you can create one in the [Doppler Service](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/service-tokens).

Once you generated the `API Key` there are two ways to communicate your authorization tokens to Pulumi:

1. Set the environment variables `DOPPLER_API_KEY` and `DOPPLER_ACCOUNT_ID`:

    ```bash
    $ export DOPPLER_API_KEY=cu_xxx
    $ export DOPPLER_ACCOUNT_ID=xxx
    ```

2. Set them using `pulumi config` command, if you prefer that they be stored alongside your Pulumi stack for easy multi-user access:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set doppler:apiKey cu_xxx --secret
    $ pulumi config set doppler:accountId xxx
    ```

> Remember to pass `--secret` when setting `doppler:apiKey` so it is properly encrypted.
