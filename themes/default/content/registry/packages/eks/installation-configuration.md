{{< aws-resource-note >}}

To provision a Kubernetes cluster with the Amazon EKS component, you need to have AWS credentials. Use the instructions on the AWS Classic Provider's [Installation & Configuration](/registry/packages/aws/installation-configuration) to get credentials if needed.

Your AWS credentials are never sent to pulumi.com. Pulumi uses the AWS SDK and the credentials in your environment to authenticate requests from your computer to AWS.

## Installation

The Amazon EKS provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/eks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/eks)
* Python: [`pulumi_eks`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-eks/)
* Go: [`github.com/pulumi/pulumi-eks/sdk/go/eks`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-eks)
* .NET: [`Pulumi.Eks`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.Eks)
* Java: [`com.pulumi.eks`](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.pulumi.eks)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need to install some pre-requisites:

* [AWS CLI version 1.16.156 or later](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html):
  Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide secure authentication to your Kubernetes cluster.

These are not required but are recommended if you plan on interacting with your Kubernetes cluster:

* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): the standard Kubernetes command line interface.
* [`helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/): if you plan on deploying Helm charts to your cluster.
