## Installation

The Google Cloud Native provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/google-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/google-native)
* Python: [`pulumi-google-native`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-google-native/)
* Go: [`github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native/sdk/go/google`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-google-native)
* .NET: [`Pulumi.GoogleNative`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.GoogleNative)

## Configuration

To provision resources with the Pulumi Google Cloud Provider, you need to have Google credentials.

{{% configure-gcp type="google-native" %}}

{{% notes "info" %}}
If you are using Pulumi in an non-interactive setting (such as a CI/CD system) you will need to [configure and use a service account](/registry/packages/gcp/service-account) instead.
{{% /notes %}}

### Configuration Options

Use `pulumi config set google-native:<option>` or pass options to the [constructor of `new Provider`](/registry/packages/google-native/api-docs/provider).

| Option  Required? | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `project` | Optional | The default project for new resources, if one is not specified when creating a resource. This can also be specified using any of the following environment variables (listed in order of precedence): `GOOGLE_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT`. |
| `region` | Optional | The region to operate under, if not specified by a given resource. This can also be specified using any of the following environment variables (listed in order of precedence): `GOOGLE_REGION`, `GCLOUD_REGION`, `CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION`. |
| `zone` | Optional | The zone to operate under, if not specified by a given resource.  This can also be specified using any of the following environment variables (listed in order of precedence): `GOOGLE_ZONE`, `GCLOUD_ZONE`, `CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE`. |

### Use environment variables

We recommend using `pulumi config` for the options above, but you can also set many of the options above as environment variables instead.

* `GOOGLE_PROJECT` - The default project for new resources, if one is not specified when creating a resource
* `GOOGLE_REGION` - The default region for new resources, if one is not specified when creating a resource
* `GOOGLE_ZONE` - The default zone for new resources, if one is not specified when creating a resource.

### Dynamically generate credentials

In addition to configuring the Google Native provider locally, you also have the option to centralize your configurations using [Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration)](/docs/pulumi-cloud/esc/). Using this service will enable you to run Pulumi CLI commands with dynamically generated credentials, removing the need to configure and manage your credentials locally.

To do this, you will need to complete the following steps:

#### Configure OIDC between Pulumi and GCP

Refer to the [Configuring OpenID Connect for GCP Guide](/docs/pulumi-cloud/oidc/gcp/) for the step-by-step process on how to do this.

### [Optional] Move Pulumi config to your ESC environment

You can centralize your Pulumi configuration using Pulumi ESC. You can define and expose environment variables as shown below:

```yaml
values:
  gcp:
    login:
      fn::open::gcp-login:
        project: <your-project-id>
        oidc:
          workloadPoolId: <your-pool-id>
          providerId: <your-provider-id>
          serviceAccount: <your-service-account>
  pulumiConfig:
    gcp:accessToken: ${gcp.login.accessToken}
  environmentVariables:
    GOOGLE_PROJECT: ${gcp.login.project}
    GOOGLE_REGION: <your-region>
    GOOGLE_ZONE: <your-zone>
```

{{< notes type="warning" >}}
Your GCP access token must always be defined under the `pulumiConfig` section. The deployment will fail if it is defined as an environment variable in the `environmentVariables` section.
{{< /notes >}}

To [expose configuration values to Pulumi IaC](/docs/pulumi-cloud/esc/environments/#using-environments-with-pulumi-iac), you will need to add any desired values underneath the `pulumiConfig` key. Further, if your workflow does not require the exposure of environment variables, you can also define those variables under the `pulumiConfig` block as shown below:

```yaml
values:
  gcp:
    login:
      fn::open::gcp-login:
        project: <your-project-id>
        oidc:
          workloadPoolId: <your-pool-id>
          providerId: <your-provider-id>
          serviceAccount: <your-service-account>
  pulumiConfig:
    project:environment: 'dev'
    gcp:accessToken: ${gcp.login.accessToken}
    gcp:project: ${gcp.login.project}
    gcp:region: <your-region>
    gcp:zone: <your-zone>
```

This will ensure that those values are scoped only to your `pulumi` run.

{{< notes type="info" >}}
The configuration values under `pulumiConfig` can also be referenced directly from within your Pulumi program code. This is done using the same method to reference values from your project's stack settings file. You can see examples of how to do this in the [Accessing Configuration from Code](/docs/concepts/config/#code) section of the Pulumi documentation.

#### Import your environment

The last step is to update your project's stack settings file (`Pulumi.<stack-name>.yaml`) to import your ESC environment as shown below:

```yaml
environment:
  - <your-environment-name>
```

Make sure to replace `<your-environment-name>` with the name of the ESC environment you created in the previous steps.

You can test that your configuration is working by running the `pulumi preview` command. This will validate that your GCP resources can be deployed using the dynamically generated credentials in your environment file.

{{< notes type="info" >}}
Make sure that your local environment does not have GCP credentials configured before running this command. You can logout by running the `gcloud auth revoke` command.
