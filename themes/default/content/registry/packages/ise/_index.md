title: Cisco ISE Provider
meta_desc: Provides an overview on how to configure the Pulumi Cisco ISE provider.
layout: package
---
## Installation

The Cisco ISE provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/ise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/ise)
* Python: [`pulumi-ise`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-ise/)
* Go: [`github.com/pulumi/pulumi-ise/sdk/go/ise`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-ise)
* .NET: [`Pulumi.Ise`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.Ise)
* Java: [`com.pulumi/ise`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.pulumi/ise)
## Overview

The ISE provider provides resources to interact with a Cisco ISE (Identity Service Engine) instance. It communicates with ISE via the REST API.

This provider uses both, the ERS and Open API. Instructions on how to enable API access can be found here: <https://developer.cisco.com/docs/identity-services-engine/latest/#!cisco-ise-api-framework>

All resources and functions have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform |    Version    |
|----------|---------------|
| ISE      | 3.2.0 Patch 4 |
| ISE      | 3.3.0         |
