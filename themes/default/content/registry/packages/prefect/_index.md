layout: package
---

## Generate Provider

The Prefect provider must be installed as a Local Package by following the [instructions for Any Terraform Provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/terraform-provider/):

```bash
pulumi package add terraform-provider prefecthq/prefect
```
## Overview

Use the [Prefect](https://prefect.io) provider to configure your Prefect infrastructure.

See getting started for more information on setting up the provider.

See troubleshoting for resources to address potential errors.
## Configuration Reference

- `accountId` (String) Default Prefect Cloud Account ID. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable.
- `apiKey` (String, Sensitive) Prefect Cloud API key. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `basicAuthKey` (String, Sensitive) Prefect basic auth key. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_BASIC_AUTH_KEY` environment variable.
- `endpoint` (String) The Prefect API URL. Can also be set via the `PREFECT_API_URL` environment variable. Defaults to `https://api.prefect.cloud` if not configured. Can optionally include the default account ID and workspace ID in the following format: `https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/<accountID>/workspaces/<workspaceID>`. This is the same format used for the `PREFECT_API_URL` value in the Prefect CLI configuration file. The `accountId` and `workspaceId` attributes and their matching environment variables will take priority over any account and workspace ID values provided in the `endpoint` attribute.
- `workspaceId` (String) Default Prefect Cloud Workspace ID.
