## Generate Provider

The Rke provider must be installed as a Local Package by following the [instructions for Any Terraform Provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/terraform-provider/):

```bash
pulumi package add terraform-provider rancher/rke
```
~> **NOTE:** This provider was previously published as @pulumi/rke.
However, that package is no longer being updated.Going forward, it is available as a [Local Package](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/any-terraform-provider/) instead.
Please see the [provider's repository](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-rke) for details.
