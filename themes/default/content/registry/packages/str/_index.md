title: String
meta_desc: The Pulumi String provider provides a set of simple string functions accessible from all languages (including Pulumi YAML).
layout: overview
---

The Pulumi String provider contains a set of string manipulation functions that are
identical across languages. These functions are especially useful for Pulumi YAML, which
lacks native support for arbitrary string manipulation.

The expected use case is in Pulumi YAML programs, or Pulumi programs generated by Pulumi Eject.

## Examples

### Replace within a string

{{< chooser language "yaml" >}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```yaml
variables:
  simple-replace:
    Fn::str:replace:
      string: fizz-bar
      old: bar
      new: buzz

  regexp-replace:
    Fn::str:regexp:replace:
      string: fizz-foo-bar
      old: -.*
      new: -buzz

outputs:
  simple-replace: # fizz-buzz
    ${simple-replace.result}
  regexp-replace: # fizz-buzz
    ${regexp-replace.result}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{< /chooser >}}
