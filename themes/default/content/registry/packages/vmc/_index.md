##

In order to use the provider you need to obtain the authentication token from the Cloud Service Provider by providing
the org scoped API token. The provider client uses Cloud Service Provider (CSP) API to exchange this org scoped API
token/OAuth App ID and Secret for user access token.

Refer to the provider documentation for information on all of the resources
and functions supported by this provider. Each includes a detailed
description of the purpose and how to use it.
