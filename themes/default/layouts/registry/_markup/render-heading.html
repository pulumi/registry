{{/*
    The README files we ingest from pulumi/examples are written such that the top-level
    heading (the H1) is the title of the example itself, which works fine on GitHub, but not
    so well in the Registry, where these guides are situated within the context of a package
    (whose name is the H1). Since we want at most one H1 per page, this Hugo
    Markdown-rendering hook shifts all headings on how-to guide pages by one level, turning H1s
    into H2s, H2s into H3s, and so on.
